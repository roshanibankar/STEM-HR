    <h2>Our Story</h2>

    <p>
        STEM HR Services began with one woman’s vision and a simple belief that great people deserve to be discovered.
        Our founder, <strong>Mia Conrads</strong>, started her career as an engineer in a competitive, male-dominated industry. Despite her qualifications, she faced countless closed doors, underestimated not because of her ability, but because of how the system overlooked true potential.
    </p>

    <p>
        After years of navigating the STEM world, she realized that the issue wasn't a lack of talent it was a gap in how companies searched for it. Mia decided to change that.
        She left her corporate role and poured her savings, heart, and sleepless nights into building a platform that didn’t just fill positions it opened doors.

    <p>
        What started at her kitchen table with a notebook and a borrowed laptop is now a growing team committed to connecting diverse STEM professionals with companies who value them.
        Today, STEM HR Services has helped hundreds of job seekers find their purpose and helped companies build teams that innovate with integrity.
